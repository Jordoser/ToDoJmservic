This application is a simple todolist app that allows user to add todos, check them, archive them, email them and, provide a summary of all check and unchecked todos.

The Student Picker video series created by Abram Hindle was used to guide and help during the creation of this app and many of the solutions from these videos are implemented in this application. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PPD0ncJU1g (Sept. 25 2014)
